Create instant meetings with your clients or potential clients.

Create instant meetings with your students, family or friends.

Mantain communications in the actual COVID-19 crisis.
And maybe future COVID-XX :(

How to:

1. Create a new Hello I am here! from admin
2. Insert shortcode [show-meet] in any page. Or create a new page and insert there.
3. Send your client/student/friend/... the meeting code and the page url
4. You and your client/studen/friend/... put the meeting code in the page

The page with the shortcode [show-meet] can be used forever for all the meetings.
Or you can put the shortcode in some other places, too.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Plugin Name screen to configure the plugin
